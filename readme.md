Fantastic! You've generated all the necessary outputs. The coding and analysis portion of the hackathon is officially complete. Your `final_output_df` is ready, and your analysis of STL provides a powerful story.

You are in the final stage. The only thing left is to package your incredible work into a compelling presentation and prepare your submission files.

### Final Step: Build Your Presentation & Submit üèÜ

Now it's time to be a data storyteller and business strategist. You will use the outputs you just generated to build a narrative for United Airlines.

#### 1. Build Your Presentation (7-8 Slides)

Here is a slide-by-slide guide to creating a high-impact presentation.

- **Slide 1: Title Slide**

  - Title: A Data-Driven Flight Difficulty Score to Enhance Operational Efficiency
  - Your Name

- **Slide 2: Executive Summary (The Elevator Pitch)**

  - **The Problem:** Nearly 50% of flights from ORD depart late, driven by inconsistent, experience-based resource planning.
  - **Our Solution:** We developed a daily Flight Difficulty Score that systematically ranks every flight by its operational complexity.
  - **Key Finding:** The primary drivers of difficulty are extreme ground time pressure and high volumes of transfer baggage, particularly on short-haul routes like St. Louis (STL).
  - **Top Recommendation:** Proactively allocate specialized ground crews and baggage handlers to the top 5% of 'Difficult' flights each day, starting with the STL route.

- **Slide 3: Key Findings from the Data**

  - Use your most powerful EDA numbers.
  - **"Departure Delays are Widespread":** Show the "Average delay: 21.19 minutes" and "49.7% of flights depart late."
  - **"Ground Time is a Critical Bottleneck":** Highlight that "621 flights were scheduled with less than the minimum required turnaround time," putting them at risk before the day even began.
  - **"ORD is a Complex Transfer Hub":** Note the high average ratio of ~3 transfer bags for every checked bag.

- **Slide 4: Our Solution: The Flight Difficulty Score**

  - Briefly explain your model.
  - **Features:** List the features you used (`ground_time_pressure`, `passenger_load_factor`, etc.).
  - **Weighting:** Explain your logic. "We assigned the highest weight (30%) to **Ground Time Pressure** because our EDA revealed it was a significant and direct operational constraint. **Transfer Bag Ratio** received the next highest weight (20%) due to ORD's role as a major hub."

- **Slide 5: Analysis Deep Dive: St. Louis (STL)**

  - This is where you use your latest output!
  - Show the "Top 10 Most Difficult Destinations" list, with STL at the top.
  - Display the comparison table for STL.
  - **The Story:** "Flights to St. Louis are **44% more delayed** than the airport average. Our analysis reveals two clear reasons why: they have **51% less ground time buffer** and handle **50% more transfer bags**."

- **Slide 6: Actionable Recommendations**

  - Turn your STL analysis into concrete actions.
  - **Recommendation 1 (Address Ground Time):** "For the top 5 daily 'Difficult' flights to STL, we recommend pre-assigning an expanded ground crew to guarantee the aircraft is ready for boarding ahead of schedule, directly countering the -51% ground time pressure."
  - **Recommendation 2 (Address Transfer Bags):** "For STL-bound flights, baggage handlers should prioritize sorting transfer bags. Since these flights handle 50% more transfers, this targeted approach will reduce mishandled bags and departure delays waiting on baggage."

- **Slide 7: Conclusion & Business Impact**
  - Summarize the value of your solution.
  - **From Reactive to Proactive:** Your score allows teams to plan for difficulty _before_ it happens.
  - **Data-Driven Decisions:** Replaces guesswork with a consistent, scalable system.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Improved on-time performance, more efficient use of resources, and reduced employee stress.

### 2. Finalize Your Submission Package

You're ready to submit. Just run through this final checklist.

1.  **Presentation:** Save your slides as a PDF.
2.  **CSV File:** You have already created `test_yourname.csv`. Make sure it's named correctly.
3.  **Code:** Clean up your Python notebook. Add comments to explain your steps. Write a simple `README.md` file with instructions if needed.
4.  **Zip Everything:** Combine the PDF, CSV, and code files into a single ZIP folder. Double-check the name and size limits.

Congratulations on completing this challenging hackathon problem from start to finish!
That's an excellent question. The process of deciding the weights is the most critical step in building a transparent and defensible scoring model. It's where you translate your analytical insights into a business tool.

The weights were not chosen randomly; they were decided based on the evidence you uncovered during your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). You assigned higher weights to the factors that your analysis proved had the strongest impact on operational difficulty and delays.

Here is a breakdown of the logic, which is also reflected in your readme.md presentation guide:

The Rationale Behind the Weights
Think of your weights as being distributed across three tiers of importance:

1. Primary Drivers (Highest Weights)
   ground_time_pressure: 0.30 (30%)
   Reasoning: Your EDA revealed this was the most significant proactive indicator of difficulty. You found that hundreds of flights were scheduled with a time deficit before the day even began. This is a direct, physical constraint on the operation, making it the most important factor.
   transfer_bag_ratio: 0.20 (20%)
   Reasoning: Your analysis showed that ORD is a major transfer hub and that transfer bags are inherently more complex to handle than origin bags. A high proportion of these bags puts significant strain on baggage crews and is a major risk for delays, justifying its high weight.
2. Secondary Drivers (Medium Weights)
   passenger_load_factor: 0.15 (15%)
   Reasoning: Your analysis showed that the correlation between load factor and delay was weak on its own. However, a full flight is still undeniably more complex than an empty one (more people to board, more carry-ons). It's a contributing factor, but not a primary driver, so it gets a moderate weight.
   ssr_count: 0.15 (15%)
   Reasoning: Your controlled analysis proved that a high number of Special Service Requests (SSRs) leads to greater delays, even after accounting for how full the flight is. This confirmed it as an independent driver of complexity related to passenger needs, earning it a solid medium weight.
3. Supporting Drivers (Lowest Weights)
   hot_transfer: 0.10 (10%)
   Reasoning: This is a more specific version of the transfer bag issue. While important, it's a subset of the overall baggage complexity. It gets a distinct weight to flag these time-critical bags but is less impactful than the overall ratio.
   child_count & lap_child_count: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 (10% total)
   Reasoning: These features are excellent proxies for the presence of young families who may require more time and assistance during boarding. They add valuable nuance to the score but are less impactful on a macro level than major constraints like ground time.
   In summary, you told a story with your weights: "The biggest problems are time and bags. The next biggest problems are the needs of the people on board. Everything else adds a little extra complexity." This data-driven approach is what makes your model so effective.
   "Our model identified St. Louis as the most consistently difficult destination. We investigated why, and found that these flights have 51% less ground time and 50% more transfer bags than average..."
